# AIOps Base Runtime

Minimal base code for the AIOps pipeline described in `docs/`.

```

`__init__.py` files only re-export public classes. Pipeline logic stays in named modules.
Add new Pydantic classes under `aiops/schemas/`, not beside the business logic.

## Shared Code

- `aiops.shared.features.index_features`: build a `signal_id -> Feature` map.
- `aiops.shared.features.find_feature`: lookup one feature by `signal_id`.

These are reused by detectors, enrichment, and verification. Other code is still small and module-specific, so it stays local until real duplication appears.

## Run Tests

```sh
conda run -n capstone python -B -m unittest discover -s tests
```

## Live Smoke Test Through EKS Port-Forward

The canonical endpoint and credential inventory is in
[`docs/live_endpoints.md`](docs/live_endpoints.md). From `src/aio`, keep the
port-forward helper running in one terminal:

```powershell
Copy-Item .env.live.example .env.live
powershell -File scripts/port_forward.ps1
```

To test the inbound Grafana webhook, start AIOps in a second terminal. Use
`AIOPS_ENV_FILE`; do not copy `.env.live` over the tracked `.env` template:

```powershell
$env:AIOPS_ENV_FILE = ".env.live"
python -m uvicorn aiops.api.app:create_app --factory --port 8000
```

Run all strict connectivity checks, or one integration group, in a third
terminal:

```powershell
python -B tests/smoke_test_live.py
python -B tests/smoke_test_live.py TestPrometheus
```

Missing credentials, authentication errors, non-2xx responses, and unreachable
endpoints fail the suite; they are not reported as successful skips.

## Configuration

Runtime secrets, URLs, paths, and all numeric hyperparameters are loaded from `.env` through `aiops.config.Settings`.
Set `AIOPS_ENV_FILE=.env.live` to select the ignored live file without copying
secrets into the tracked template.
Infrastructure topology, signal IDs, detector definitions, and policy lists are loaded from `config/runtime.json`.
Detector thresholds and detector confidences are intentionally kept in `config/runtime.json` beside detector IDs.
RCA, remediation, no-data, and correlation hyperparameters are loaded from `config/hyperparameters.json`.

- Hyperparameters: RCA, remediation, no-data, correlation.
- Runtime paths: API paths, evidence dir, state store path.
- Operational IDs: detector IDs, signal IDs, runbook IDs, severity, environment.
- Safety policy values: protected targets, stateful kinds, non-actionable flows.
- Integration credentials: Prometheus, Grafana webhook, Jaeger, OpenSearch, Kubernetes API, notification webhook, AIE status, CDO cost feed, live executor.

List/set/map values use JSON syntax in `.env`:

```env
AIOPS_NO_DATA_REQUIRED_SIGNAL_IDS=["checkout_bad_ratio_24h"]
AIOPS_PROTECTED_TARGETS=["flagd","openfeature","secrets","btc-incident"]
```

## Current Scope

This baseline includes FastAPI routes, SQLite incident persistence, config-driven detectors, HTTP integration clients, and the v0.0.1 anomaly/RCA path:

- univariate EWMA plus seasonal residual scoring
- per-service multivariate isolation-style scoring
- BARO `bocpd`
- graph traversal RCA plus BARO `robust_scorer`

It still does not perform Kubernetes mutation directly.

## Integrations

Direct outbound clients live under `aiops/integrations/`:

- `PrometheusClient`
- `JaegerClient`
- `OpenSearchClient`
- `KubernetesClient` for read-only status
- `NotificationClient`
- `AieClient`
- `CostClient`
- `LiveExecutorClient` for the optional separate executor

Grafana is inbound at `POST /api/v1/events/grafana`.

Blocked by design: Kubernetes Secrets, database mutation, flagd/OpenFeature mutation, and direct Kubernetes mutation from the normal runtime.

## Dependency

The codebase uses Pydantic v2 models for all domain contracts. The expected local runtime is the Conda env named `capstone`.

FastAPI is used only in the API layer. Core pipeline code stays framework-free.
